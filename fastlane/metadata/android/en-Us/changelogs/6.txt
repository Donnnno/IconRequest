Release 1.7.0

New Features
Instead of using the currently applied icon pack now you can choose one of your installed icon packs
- check if your apps exist in an econ pack and only show non-existing
- show an second icon beside the standard app icon from an icon pack

note: you may have to close the app to get the second icon correct loaded
